# Gravitational forces visualizations

This project contains two simple visualizations made in Processing.

## Gravitational forcefield visualization
Two planets are orbiting each other, with a vector grid as the background, and the planets' gravitational forces are affecting the color and length of each vector, resulting in a clear visualization of the forces in play.

## Solar system visualization
This is a different setup made inside the same project. A static "sun" is placed in the middle, and 16 "planets" are carefully placed on orbit around this sun. For the sake of simplicity, the planets are not affecting each other in this simulation.
